    <h1>The history of Rock!</h1>
    <h2>AC / DC</h2>
    <h2>The Band</h2>
    <p>
      AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. Their music has been described by music journalists as hard rock, blues rock, and, controversially, heavy metal; the group have defined themselves as "a rock and roll band, nothing more, nothing less".

      AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until Cliff Williams replaced Mark Evans as bassist in 1977 for the album Powerage. In February 1980, a few months after recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died of "acute alcohol poisoning". The group considered disbanding but stayed together, bringing in Brian Johnson as replacement for Scott. Later that year, the band released their first album with Johnson, Back in Black, which they dedicated to Scott's memory. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.
